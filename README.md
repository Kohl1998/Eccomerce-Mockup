# Eccomerce Mockup webpage

## Description

For this application I put my css flexbox knowledge to the test by creating a webpage based on the eccomerce niche where I could showcase some of my favourite designers. 

The motivation for this project came from me wanting to further challenge my understanding around flexbox/grids, so I could build personal projects using those css skills in future for myself or even potential clients. 

## Installation

I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code.

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.
